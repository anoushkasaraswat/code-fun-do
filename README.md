The technology today has advanced to an extent that the computational algorithms and computer based data analysis can be used to make
large and effective decisions. An essential role of such technologies in human life is felt when they provide ease in various domains 
and help make future plans for managing risks. Among all the various issues, one of the major issues that comes into picture is the
disaster issue due to which every year the world loses many of its residents. Hereby, we propose a solution to this major issue.

The proposed work includes three main contributions for prediction based technique development. Firstly, we generate the test and training
dataset using Google API. In this, data processed is filtered and transformed from an unstructured to structured dataset. 
Our next challenge is to develop an accurate and precise structure learning of the disasters, their places of origin and their nature. The methods to be used 
 used would be k-means clustering and hidden Markov model. For the final stage, we will evaluate the probablities of occurrence of disasters in
the future based on the dataset of the current scenario. We will implement this using Python.

In this proposed solution the supervised data mining technique would be
used to evaluate the historical data and the natural events and
predict the upcoming events. This task can be efficiently performed with the
help of data mining algorithms by analysing the news contents from various online news sources after checking their reliability.
Therefore, different processes of the data mining techniques like machine learning algorithms would be
combined together for developing the enhanced scheme for the prediction. In order to prepare the
proposed data model, there is a need to perform the collection of data,
pre-processing of data to create a structured dataset, data model development and finally
utilizing the data model for predicting the upcoming natural disasters. This would greatly 
reduce the number of lives that are compromised
due to sudden encounter of natural events.
